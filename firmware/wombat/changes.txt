1.0.8

Messages longer than 1024 bytes will be copied to the modem filesystem
and sent from there.

String utility functions have been moved to a project-specific library
and unit tests created for them.

The ULP initialisation has been moved to before the check for dropping
into the CLI. This allows pulses to be recorded while in the CLI to
make checking for them easier.

Removed the c1 on, off, and restart commands; they have not been useful.

Removed the sd read command; sd data works better.

New commands:

  mqtt pubfile <filename>: publishes a file from the SPIFFS filesystem.

  sdi12 st: Runs sensor_task to allow a quick check all the sensors are
            working. This command creates the standard JSON file on the
            SPIFFS filesystem which can then be published via
            mqtt pubfile or will be sent during the next normal run.

  spiffs ls: lists the files in the SPIFFS filesystem.

  spiffs cat <filename>: shows contents of a file on the SPIFFS
                         filesystem.

  spiffs rm <filename>: deletes a file from the SPIFFS filesystem.
