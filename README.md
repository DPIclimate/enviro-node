## About

Enviro-node is a environmental monitoring node. Users can connect a number of sensors to a node. Data captured from these sensors is then sent to a database over [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/).

There are three parts to the enviro-node.

1. The physical hardware (electronics).

2. The firmware operating on the device.

3. A [mobile application](https://github.com/DPIclimate/blue-tongue) (known as blue-tongue) for setting up the device in the field.

The first two parts are housed in this repository. The [blue-tongue](https://github.com/DPIclimate/blue-tongue) mobile application is housed in its own repository.
